# Raytracer in Rust

This is the result of me following [The Raytracer Challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39933047-the-ray-tracer-challenge) by Jamis Buck. It is an excellent book to get along in building a Raytracer from scratch. As the book is language agnostic, I decided to use it to learn Rust.

## Tests

The book encourages a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, for which Rust conveniently has built-in tooling.

To run tests from the command-line, just run

```bash
cargo test
```
